## For the organiser

This folder contains some partial code to make the face dataset.
1. Assign identities to different students based on the names suggested by them
2. Flag up potentially overlapping identities / split into train, val and test sets
3. Flag up low confidence images (for validation and test sets)
4. Convert UTF-8 identity names to alphanumeric ID
5. Make evaluation pairs for validation and test sets
